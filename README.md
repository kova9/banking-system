# Banking System 

### Before you start: 
    1. There are 10 fixed Customer ID's to keep it simplier.
    2. There are 10 fixed Accounts. Each Customer has 1 Account. 
    3. Accounts get randomly assigned to Transaction at the start of the programm. 
    4. I'm not using long values as Keys in the DB Tables because of personal preferences but there is an AccountId Enum aswell as 
       an CustomerId Enum, so while testing you can use Id's 1-10, they will get mapped accordingly.
    5. Since every customer has only one account, I took the entities provided in the specification, if there where 
       multiple accounts, I would just use an foreign key in the Accounts table instead of the Customer Table. 
    6. The Email used for the Mailing service is an test Address created for this project, so there is no need for 
       any kind of configuration.
