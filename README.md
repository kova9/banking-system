# Banking System 

### Before you start: 
    1. There are 10 fixed Customer ID's to make the testing simplier.
    2. There are 10 fixed Accounts. Each Customer has 1 Account, since I took the entities from the specification. Usually,
        I would create an foreign key in the Account table for multiple accounts per customer.
    3. I'm not using long values as Keys in the DB Tables because of personal preferences but there is an AccountId Enum aswell as 
       an CustomerId Enum, so while testing you can use Id's 1-10.
    4. The Email used for the Mailing service is an test Address created for this project, so there is no need for 
       any kind of configuration. 
    5. If you want to receive a mail, just edit the e-mail address in the customers.json file
    6. 100 000 transactions will get imported at the start of the server, aswell as 10 Customers and 10 accounts.
